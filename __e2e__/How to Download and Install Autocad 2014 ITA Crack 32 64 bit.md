## What is Autocad 2014?
 
Autocad 2014 is the 28th version of the popular computer-aided design (CAD) software developed by Autodesk. It was released in March 2013 and it is compatible with Windows and Mac operating systems. Autocad 2014 allows users to create and edit 2D and 3D drawings for various purposes, such as architecture, engineering, construction, manufacturing, and more. Autocad 2014 also supports collaboration and cloud-based services, such as Autodesk 360, which enables users to access their projects from anywhere and share them with others.
  
## What are the main features of Autocad 2014?
 
Autocad 2014 has many features that enhance the productivity and creativity of the users. Some of the main features are:

- **Autodesk Recap:** This is a new software that comes with Autocad 2014 and allows users to convert multiple photographs into a 3D model mesh and use the photographs as texture maps. This is useful for capturing the reality of a site or an object and importing it into Autocad for further editing or analysis.
- **Security features:** Autocad 2014 has improved security features to combat the growing list of malware that target Autocad files. Users can now sign their drawings digitally and verify the signatures of others. Users can also encrypt their drawings with passwords and restrict access to certain parts of the drawings.
- **Geo-Location:** Autocad 2014 allows users to link their drawings to maps, such as Google Earth, and display them in a geographic context. Users can also specify the location of their project on a map and use it as a base for their design. This feature is only available to Autodesk 360 accounts.
- **Design Feed:** This is a feature that enables users to communicate with others about their drawings by tagging the drawing and posting comments. Users can also include images from their mobile devices and chat in real time. This feature is also integrated with Autodesk 360 and allows users to share their drawings on the cloud.
- **Command prompt update:** The command prompt in Autocad 2014 has been updated with several features that make it more user-friendly and efficient. For example, users can now customize the AutoCorrect feature, which suggests alternative commands when users type a wrong command. Users can also use the Synonym Lookup feature, which provides synonyms for common commands, such as "round" for "fillet". Users can also find user layer names and block names while typing them at the command prompt.
- **New File Tab:** This is a new feature that resides under the ribbon menu and allows users to easily open, close, and switch between drawings. Users can also preview the thumbnails of their drawings and access recently used files.

These are some of the main features of Autocad 2014 that make it a powerful and versatile tool for designing and documenting projects.
