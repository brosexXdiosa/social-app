The games are emulated faithfully and run smoothly on the PS3, with options to adjust the screen size, filter and region. You can also save and load your progress at any time, which is handy for some of the harder or longer games. The graphics and sound are preserved as they were on the original console, so don't expect any HD remasters or enhancements. However, some games do support trophies and online leaderboards, which add some replay value and challenge.
 
The collection is a great way to experience some of the best games from SEGA's 16-bit era, or to revisit them if you grew up with them. The variety and quality of the games is impressive, and there is something for everyone, whether you like platformers, beat 'em ups, RPGs, shooters or puzzles. The only downside is that some games are missing from the collection, such as Sonic 3 & Knuckles (which is only available as separate games), Sonic CD, Gunstar Heroes and Rocket Knight Adventures. Also, some of the arcade and Master System games are hidden behind obscure unlock conditions, which might frustrate some players.
 
Overall, SEGA MEGA DRIVE Ultimate Collection is a must-have for retro gamers and SEGA fans alike. It offers hours of fun and nostalgia for a reasonable price, and it showcases some of the best games from one of the most iconic consoles of all time. If you have a PS3 and love classic gaming, you should definitely give this collection a try.
  
One of the main attractions of SEGA MEGA DRIVE Ultimate Collection is the ability to play some of the games in high-definition, with a resolution of up to 720p. This means that the games look sharper and more vibrant on modern TVs, without losing their original charm and style. You can also choose to play the games in their original aspect ratio or stretch them to fit your screen, depending on your preference. The sound quality is also improved, with crisp and clear music and sound effects that enhance the retro atmosphere.
 
Another feature that adds value to the collection is the inclusion of some bonus games that are not part of the Mega Drive library, but are related to it in some way. For example, you can unlock arcade versions of Altered Beast, Space Harrier and Zaxxon, which are more faithful to the original coin-ops than their Mega Drive ports. You can also unlock some Master System games, such as Golden Axe Warrior, Phantasy Star and Alien Syndrome, which are rare and hard to find nowadays. These bonus games are not just filler, but offer some interesting variations and challenges for fans of the Mega Drive era.
 
SEGA MEGA DRIVE Ultimate Collection is a great way to relive some of the best moments of 16-bit gaming, or to discover them for the first time if you missed them back then. The collection offers a diverse and enjoyable selection of games that showcase SEGA's creativity and innovation in the genre. Whether you want to speed through colourful levels as Sonic, fight against crime as Axel or Blaze, explore exotic worlds as Ecco or Ristar, or save the galaxy as a Phantasy Star hero, you will find something to suit your taste and mood. The collection is also a bargain, considering that you get over 40 games for less than the price of a new release.
